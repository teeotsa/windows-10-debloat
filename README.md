# Windows 10 Debloater
This script is based of Chris Titus Tech's script! 

This script disables Windows Update (Optional), WiFi, enables Dark Mode (Optional), printing, Microsoft Account Sign-In, activation and alot more.

To disable Windows Defender and Windows Firewall, run "disablewindowsdefender.ps1" in folder. To delete system files (will improve ram usage + process count), run "deleteSystemFiles.bat" (recommended to run this file with NSudo)

Also NSudo is includud in folder! (64bit only) "x64" folder
