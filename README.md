# Restore?

Script should make **restore point** for you before starting with everything else.
So, if you still have that **restore point**, you can use that to restore your settings.
What to do if you don't have that **restore point** anymore?
Well, then you can just reinstall Windows or use my restore scripts.
You can find those restore scripts [here!](https://github.com/teeotsa/windows-10-debloat/tree/main/restoreScripts)


You can also find those restore script inside ur debloater folder.
