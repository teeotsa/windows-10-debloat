# Restore?

Script should make **restore point** for you before starting with everything else. So, if you still have that **restore point**, you can use that to restore your settings. What to do if you don't have that **restore point** anymore? Well, then you can just reinstall Windows or use my restore scripts.
You can find those restore scripts [here!](https://github.com/teeotsa/windows-10-debloat/tree/main/restoreScripts)
